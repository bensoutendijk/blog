#### Greetings,
My name is Ben Soutendijk, and I am a full stack web developer among many things. Here's some of my background and work experience.

I have had a passion for building websites since I was a kid asking my father to install Macromedia Flash, Dreamweaver, and Microsoft Frontpage on my first computer. The first code I ever worked with was [ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) in Macromedia Flash 5. I was about 10 years old, and I wanted to create a Flash website. I was no prodigy, but I was fascinated and determined to build something. I have grown since then, but as I spend my free time writing code, whether it is for hobby projects to land my next job or just to see what I can build, I'm just like I was as a kid: searching for puzzles that my mind can latch onto and provide me hours of entertainment, working at my computer.
