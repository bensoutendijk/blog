There are many different types of dog owners. Some of us treat our dogs like they were our own human children. Others see their only dog only as an animal. I like to think of myself somewhere in between.

I revere my dogs and try to make sure they are fulfilled and happy. I do this because I care about them, but I also do this for more selfish reasons. When my dogs are not happy, they make it my problem. By making sure they have these four things, I make my life easier while enriching the lives of my pets.

## Positive Reinforcement

If there is one thing you take away from this article, it should be this principle: Do not punish your dog. That's right. Don't bother to punish your dog for any reason. This may be a difficult concept to accept if you are used to telling your dog "no", shouting, or even hitting your dog to make it stop misbehaving.

There is no doubt that this kind of punishment immediately produces the outcome we want. Most dogs stop their bad behavior when you yell or raise your hand to them. However, there is a much better way to influence your dog to behave.

Show the dog what you want it to do instead of showing it that you don't like something. Never show the dog that you are angry with it. Without sounding too spiritual, I will say that dogs feed off of our energy. Getting stressed and angry with your dog only makes the dog a more stressed and angry animal. This creates a cycle, and both you and your dog suffer until you decide to focus on postive interactions.

If you punish your dog, it is likely that you have overestimated the intellect of your canine friend. People like to project onto their dogs, believing that canines can be mischevious, cruel, or Machiavellian. Trust that your dog is none of these things, but instead realize that it is a simple animal. Even the smartest dog has no capability to imagine or plan anything. Its small mind only exists in the moment, so we use this to our advantage.

For example, if your dog has just peed on your new rug, your instinct may be frustration or even anger. The rug is clean, confortable, and you enjoy it, and the dog has just ruined that for you. Instead of showing your anger or frustion, show the dog what you want it to do: take it outside to the yard where it should be doing that kind of thing. There could be many reasons that the dog has peed where it wasn't supposed to, but none of those reasons warrant punishment. The reason could be confusion, fear, or plain instinct to mark its territory, but the the dog will never understand why you would punish it for peeing on the rug. The only thing the dog will learn from being punished is that it is bad to pee around the humans. Therefore, it is much more effective to lead the dog outside and reward it for peeing out
